# Cadillac Super Cruise vs. Honda Sensing

In the past few years, car manufacturers have been adding driver assistance features to new cars. These features add convenience and safety in ways we've come to expect—like rearview cameras and automatic braking. But you might not be aware that your car can actually drive itself without any human input at all. This technology is called Autonomous Driving (ADAS), and it's available on some vehicles today.

Super Cruise and Sensing are two examples of an ADAS system. Let's examine their capabilities as well as how they rank against similar systems.

## Capabilties of Cadillac Super Cruise

Cadillac Super Cruise is an advanced driver assistance system designed to provide a hands-free, semi-autonomous driving experience. The system includes a variety of features to enhance safety, convenience, and comfort on the road.

1. Lane Centering Assist: Helps the driver stay in the center of the lane by automatically adjusting the steering wheel.

2. Active Cruise Control: Automatically adjusts the car’s speed to maintain a safe following distance from the car in front of it.

3. Super Cruise Driver Attention System: Uses infrared sensors to detect the driver’s head position, ensuring they stay alert and attentive while on the road.

4. Automatic Steering: Automatically adjusts the steering wheel to keep the vehicle within its lane, even around corners.

5. Navigation Assistance: Utilizes GPS navigation to provide turn-by-turn directions and help drivers find their way to their destination.

6. OnStar Connected Services: Allows drivers to access various services such as emergency assistance, vehicle diagnostics, and vehicle security.

## Capabilties of Honda Sensing

nHonda Sensing is a suite of driver-assistive safety and driver-assistive convenience technologies designed to help make your drive easier and safer. Honda Sensing includes the following features: 

1. Collision Mitigation Braking System (CMBS): CMBS uses a combination of radar and camera technology to detect obstacles in front of the vehicle. If a potential collision is detected, it can alert the driver and apply brake pressure to reduce the severity of a collision or avoid it altogether. 

2. Road Departure Mitigation System (RDM): RDM uses a combination of camera and radar technology to detect when the vehicle is leaving its lane without the turn signal being activated. It can then alert the driver and apply corrective steering torque to help keep the vehicle in its lane.

3. Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC): ACC uses radar technology to detect the vehicles in front and automatically adjusts the speed of the vehicle to maintain a pre-set following distance. 

4. Lane Keeping Assist System (LKAS): LKAS uses a combination of camera and steering torque technology to detect lane markings and provide corrective steering torque to help keep the vehicle in its lane. 

5. Traffic Sign Recognition (TSR): TSR uses a camera to detect and recognize speed limit signs, stop signs, and other traffic signs and can alert the driver to the current speed limit. 

6. Auto High Beam Headlights (AHB): AHB uses a camera to detect the headlights of oncoming vehicles and will automatically activate the high beams when no other vehicles are detected.
