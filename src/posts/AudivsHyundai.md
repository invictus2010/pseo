# Audi Driver Assistance Plus vs. Hyundai Smart Sense

In the past few years, car manufacturers have been adding driver assistance features to new cars. These features add convenience and safety in ways we've come to expect—like rearview cameras and automatic braking. But you might not be aware that your car can actually drive itself without any human input at all. This technology is called Autonomous Driving (ADAS), and it's available on some vehicles today.

Driver Assistance Plus and Smart Sense are two examples of an ADAS system. Let's examine their capabilities as well as how they rank against similar systems.

## Capabilties of Audi Driver Assistance Plus

Audi Driver Assistance Plus is a suite of driver assistance features designed to make driving more comfortable, convenient and safe. The features included in this package are:

•Adaptive Cruise Assist: This system uses a combination of radar and camera sensors to maintain a set distance from the car in front of you, helping you stay in the correct lane and reduce the risk of a collision.

•Audi Pre Sense: This system uses a range of sensors to detect potential hazards on the road and can warn the driver of a potential collision.

•Audi Side Assist: This system uses radar sensors to monitor blind-spot areas and can alert you when another vehicle is in your blind spot.
