# Cadillac Super Cruise vs. Buick Driver Confidence

In the past few years, car manufacturers have been adding driver assistance features to new cars. These features add convenience and safety in ways we've come to expect—like rearview cameras and automatic braking. But you might not be aware that your car can actually drive itself without any human input at all. This technology is called Autonomous Driving (ADAS), and it's available on some vehicles today.

Super Cruise and Driver Confidence are two examples of an ADAS system. Let's examine their capabilities as well as how they rank against similar systems.
