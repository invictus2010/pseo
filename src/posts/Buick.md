# Overview of Driver Confidence

In the past few years, car manufacturers have been adding driver assistance features to new cars. These features add convenience and safety in ways we've come to expectâ€”like rearview cameras and automatic braking. But you might not be aware that your car can actually drive itself without any human input at all. This technology is called Autonomous Driving (ADAS), and it's available on some vehicles today.

Driver Confidence is an example of an ADAS system. Let's examine the capabilities of Driver Confidence as well as how it ranks against similar systems.

3. Side Blind Zone Alert: This system uses radar sensors to detect vehicles in your blind spot and alert you if it senses a potential collision.

4. Rear Cross Traffic Alert: This system uses radar sensors to detect vehicles behind your car and alert you if it senses a potential collision.

5. Automatic Parking Assist: This system uses cameras and sonar sensors to guide you into parking spaces and alert you when your car is close to obstacles.
