# Honda Sensing vs. Buick Driver Confidence

In the past few years, car manufacturers have been adding driver assistance features to new cars. These features add convenience and safety in ways we've come to expectâ€”like rearview cameras and automatic braking. But you might not be aware that your car can actually drive itself without any human input at all. This technology is called Autonomous Driving (ADAS), and it's available on some vehicles today.

Sensing and Driver Confidence are two examples of an ADAS system. Let's examine their capabilities as well as how they rank against similar systems.

## Capabilties of Honda Sensing

nHonda Sensing is a suite of driver-assistive safety and driver-assistive convenience technologies designed to help make your drive easier and safer. Honda Sensing includes the following features: 

1. Collision Mitigation Braking System (CMBS): CMBS uses a combination of radar and camera technology to detect obstacles in front of the vehicle. If a potential collision is detected, it can alert the driver and apply brake pressure to reduce the severity of a collision or avoid it altogether. 

2. Road Departure Mitigation System (RDM): RDM uses a combination of camera and radar technology to detect when the vehicle is leaving its lane without the turn signal being activated. It can then alert the driver and apply corrective steering torque to help keep the vehicle in its lane.

3. Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC): ACC uses radar technology to detect the vehicles in front and automatically adjusts the speed of the vehicle to maintain a pre-set following distance. 

4. Lane Keeping Assist System (LKAS): LKAS uses a combination of camera and steering torque technology to detect lane markings and provide corrective steering torque to help keep the vehicle in its lane. 

5. Traffic Sign Recognition (TSR): TSR uses a camera to detect and recognize speed limit signs, stop signs, and other traffic signs and can alert the driver to the current speed limit. 

6. Auto High Beam Headlights (AHB): AHB uses a camera to detect the headlights of oncoming vehicles and will automatically activate the high beams when no other vehicles are detected. 

## Capabilties of Buick Driver Confidence

Buick Driver Confidence is a suite of advanced driver assistance technologies designed to help drivers stay safe and confident on the road. The features include: 

1. Forward Collision Alert: This system uses radar sensors to detect vehicles in front of your car and alert you if it senses a potential collision.

2. Lane Departure Warning: This system uses a camera to monitor lane markings and will alert you if you drift out of your lane.

3. Side Blind Zone Alert: This system uses radar sensors to detect vehicles in your blind spot and alert you if it senses a potential collision.

4. Rear Cross Traffic Alert: This system uses radar sensors to detect vehicles behind your car and alert you if it senses a potential collision.

5. Automatic Parking Assist: This system uses cameras and sonar sensors to guide you into parking spaces and alert you when your car is close to obstacles.

6. Adaptive Cruise Control: This system uses radar sensors to maintain a pre-set distance from the vehicle ahead and automatically adjusts your speed accordingly.

## Reviews of Sensing vs. Driver Confidence
What do people think of Sensing and Driver Confidence? It's helpful to ask the unbiased experts, like Consumer Reports, an independent non-biased organization. Consumer Reports gave Sensing an overall score of . Meanwhile, Driver Confidence earned an overall score of .

In the specific category of "Performance and Capabilties," Sensing scored , while Driver Confidence scored 36.

Sensing ranked  out of 18 ADAS systems evaluated, compared to Driver Confidence which came in 17 out of 18.

## The Best ADAS?
Consumer Reports's top ranking ADAS was [Comma.ai](https://comma.ai?utm_medium=ref&utm_source=jwith&utm_campaign=Honda)vsBuick, even beating the Tesla Autopilot. Compatible with over 200+ models of cars, Comma.ai is dashcam-like system that you can self-install. If you have or are looking to purchase a Honda or Buick, Comma.ai is likely compatible and can supplement either Sensing or Driver Confidence.
