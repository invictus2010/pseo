# Chevy Driver Confidence vs. Honda Sensing

In the past few years, car manufacturers have been adding driver assistance features to new cars. These features add convenience and safety in ways we've come to expectâ€”like rearview cameras and automatic braking. But you might not be aware that your car can actually drive itself without any human input at all. This technology is called Autonomous Driving (ADAS), and it's available on some vehicles today.

Driver Confidence and Sensing are two examples of an ADAS system. Let's examine their capabilities as well as how they rank against similar systems.

## Capabilties of Chevy Driver Confidence

Chevy Driver Confidence is a suite of innovative safety technologies designed to help drivers stay safe. The features included in this package are:

1. Forward Collision Alert: This alerts the driver when they are approaching an object too quickly, helping them to react and avoid a potential crash.

2. Automatic Emergency Braking: This feature detects objects in front of the vehicle and automatically applies the brakes to reduce the severity of a potential crash.

3. Lane Keep Assist with Lane Departure Warning: This feature warns the driver if they drift into another lane and can help to keep them in the lane.

4. Front Pedestrian Braking: This adds an extra layer of protection by detecting pedestrians and applying the brakes when needed.

5. Following Distance Indicator: This feature helps drivers to maintain a safe following distance by displaying on the dashboard how far they are from the vehicle in front.

6. IntelliBeam Headlamps: These automatically adjust the high-beam headlights in response to oncoming traffic and help drivers to see better at night.

## Capabilties of Honda Sensing

nHonda Sensing is a suite of driver-assistive safety and driver-assistive convenience technologies designed to help make your drive easier and safer. Honda Sensing includes the following features: 

1. Collision Mitigation Braking System (CMBS): CMBS uses a combination of radar and camera technology to detect obstacles in front of the vehicle. If a potential collision is detected, it can alert the driver and apply brake pressure to reduce the severity of a collision or avoid it altogether. 

2. Road Departure Mitigation System (RDM): RDM uses a combination of camera and radar technology to detect when the vehicle is leaving its lane without the turn signal being activated. It can then alert the driver and apply corrective steering torque to help keep the vehicle in its lane.

3. Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC): ACC uses radar technology to detect the vehicles in front and automatically adjusts the speed of the vehicle to maintain a pre-set following distance. 

4. Lane Keeping Assist System (LKAS): LKAS uses a combination of camera and steering torque technology to detect lane markings and provide corrective steering torque to help keep the vehicle in its lane. 

5. Traffic Sign Recognition (TSR): TSR uses a camera to detect and recognize speed limit signs, stop signs, and other traffic signs and can alert the driver to the current speed limit. 

6. Auto High Beam Headlights (AHB): AHB uses a camera to detect the headlights of oncoming vehicles and will automatically activate the high beams when no other vehicles are detected.
