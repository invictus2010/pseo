# Mazda i-ACTIVSENSE vs. Honda Sensing

In the past few years, car manufacturers have been adding driver assistance features to new cars. These features add convenience and safety in ways we've come to expectâ€”like rearview cameras and automatic braking. But you might not be aware that your car can actually drive itself without any human input at all. This technology is called Autonomous Driving (ADAS), and it's available on some vehicles today.

i-ACTIVSENSE and Sensing are two examples of an ADAS system. Let's examine their capabilities as well as how they rank against similar systems.

## Capabilties of Mazda i-ACTIVSENSE

Mazda i-ACTIVSENSE is a suite of advanced safety technologies designed to help drivers recognize and respond to potential hazards on the road. The features of Mazda i-ACTIVSENSE include: 

1. Mazda Radar Cruise Control (MRCC): This feature uses radar to detect the vehicle ahead and helps maintain a preset speed and distance from it. 

2. Smart Brake Support (SBS): SBS helps reduce the likelihood of a collision when driving at low speeds. It can detect vehicles and pedestrians ahead and will apply the brakes if necessary. 

3. Driver Attention Alert (DAA): This feature monitors the driver&#39;s behavior and provides a warning if it senses the driver is distracted or drowsy. 

4. Lane Departure Warning System (LDWS): LDWS uses a camera to detect lane markings on the road and will provide an audio and visual warning if it senses the vehicle is straying outside the lane. 

5. Smart City Brake Support (SCBS): This feature uses a laser sensor to detect vehicles and pedestrians ahead and will apply the brakes if necessary. 

6. Adaptive Front-lighting System (AFS): AFS helps the driver see better in darkness by automatically adjusting the headlight angle when cornering.

## Capabilties of Honda Sensing

nHonda Sensing is a suite of driver-assistive safety and driver-assistive convenience technologies designed to help make your drive easier and safer. Honda Sensing includes the following features: 

1. Collision Mitigation Braking System (CMBS): CMBS uses a combination of radar and camera technology to detect obstacles in front of the vehicle. If a potential collision is detected, it can alert the driver and apply brake pressure to reduce the severity of a collision or avoid it altogether. 

2. Road Departure Mitigation System (RDM): RDM uses a combination of camera and radar technology to detect when the vehicle is leaving its lane without the turn signal being activated. It can then alert the driver and apply corrective steering torque to help keep the vehicle in its lane.

3. Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC): ACC uses radar technology to detect the vehicles in front and automatically adjusts the speed of the vehicle to maintain a pre-set following distance. 

4. Lane Keeping Assist System (LKAS): LKAS uses a combination of camera and steering torque technology to detect lane markings and provide corrective steering torque to help keep the vehicle in its lane. 

5. Traffic Sign Recognition (TSR): TSR uses a camera to detect and recognize speed limit signs, stop signs, and other traffic signs and can alert the driver to the current speed limit. 

6. Auto High Beam Headlights (AHB): AHB uses a camera to detect the headlights of oncoming vehicles and will automatically activate the high beams when no other vehicles are detected. 

## Reviews of i-ACTIVSENSE vs. Sensing
What do people think of i-ACTIVSENSE and Sensing? It's helpful to ask the unbiased experts, like Consumer Reports, an independent non-biased organization. Consumer Reports gave i-ACTIVSENSE an overall score of . Meanwhile, Sensing earned an overall score of .

In the specific category of "Performance and Capabilties," i-ACTIVSENSE scored , while Sensing scored .

i-ACTIVSENSE ranked  out of 18 ADAS systems evaluated, compared to Sensing which came in  out of 18.

## The Best ADAS?
Consumer Reports's top ranking ADAS was [Comma.ai](https://comma.ai?utm_medium=ref&utm_source=jwith&utm_campaign=Mazda)vsHonda, even beating the Tesla Autopilot. Compatible with over 200+ models of cars, Comma.ai is dashcam-like system that you can self-install. If you have or are looking to purchase a Mazda or Honda, Comma.ai is likely compatible and can supplement either i-ACTIVSENSE or Sensing.
