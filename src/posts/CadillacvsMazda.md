# Cadillac Super Cruise vs. Mazda i-ACTIVSENSE

In the past few years, car manufacturers have been adding driver assistance features to new cars. These features add convenience and safety in ways we've come to expect—like rearview cameras and automatic braking. But you might not be aware that your car can actually drive itself without any human input at all. This technology is called Autonomous Driving (ADAS), and it's available on some vehicles today.

Super Cruise and i-ACTIVSENSE are two examples of an ADAS system. Let's examine their capabilities as well as how they rank against similar systems.

## Capabilties of Cadillac Super Cruise

Cadillac Super Cruise is an advanced driver assistance system designed to provide a hands-free, semi-autonomous driving experience. The system includes a variety of features to enhance safety, convenience, and comfort on the road.

1. Lane Centering Assist: Helps the driver stay in the center of the lane by automatically adjusting the steering wheel.

2. Active Cruise Control: Automatically adjusts the car’s speed to maintain a safe following distance from the car in front of it.

3. Super Cruise Driver Attention System: Uses infrared sensors to detect the driver’s head position, ensuring they stay alert and attentive while on the road.

4. Automatic Steering: Automatically adjusts the steering wheel to keep the vehicle within its lane, even around corners.

5. Navigation Assistance: Utilizes GPS navigation to provide turn-by-turn directions and help drivers find their way to their destination.

6. OnStar Connected Services: Allows drivers to access various services such as emergency assistance, vehicle diagnostics, and vehicle security.

## Capabilties of Mazda i-ACTIVSENSE

Mazda i-ACTIVSENSE is a suite of advanced safety technologies designed to help drivers recognize and respond to potential hazards on the road. The features of Mazda i-ACTIVSENSE include: 

1. Mazda Radar Cruise Control (MRCC): This feature uses radar to detect the vehicle ahead and helps maintain a preset speed and distance from it. 

2. Smart Brake Support (SBS): SBS helps reduce the likelihood of a collision when driving at low speeds. It can detect vehicles and pedestrians ahead and will apply the brakes if necessary. 

3. Driver Attention Alert (DAA): This feature monitors the driver&#39;s behavior and provides a warning if it senses the driver is distracted or drowsy. 

4. Lane Departure Warning System (LDWS): LDWS uses a camera to detect lane markings on the road and will provide an audio and visual warning if it senses the vehicle is straying outside the lane. 

5. Smart City Brake Support (SCBS): This feature uses a laser sensor to detect vehicles and pedestrians ahead and will apply the brakes if necessary. 

6. Adaptive Front-lighting System (AFS): AFS helps the driver see better in darkness by automatically adjusting the headlight angle when cornering.
