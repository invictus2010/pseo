# Overview of Smart Sense

In the past few years, car manufacturers have been adding driver assistance features to new cars. These features add convenience and safety in ways we've come to expectâ€”like rearview cameras and automatic braking. But you might not be aware that your car can actually drive itself without any human input at all. This technology is called Autonomous Driving (ADAS), and it's available on some vehicles today.

Smart Sense is an example of an ADAS system. Let's examine the capabilities of Smart Sense as well as how it ranks against similar systems.
