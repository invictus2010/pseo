# Volkswagen Driver Assist vs. Acura Sensing

In the past few years, car manufacturers have been adding driver assistance features to new cars. These features add convenience and safety in ways we've come to expectâ€”like rearview cameras and automatic braking. But you might not be aware that your car can actually drive itself without any human input at all. This technology is called Autonomous Driving (ADAS), and it's available on some vehicles today.

Driver Assist and Sensing are two examples of an ADAS system. Let's examine their capabilities as well as how they rank against similar systems.

## Capabilties of Volkswagen Driver Assist

Mazda i-ACTIVSENSE is a suite of advanced safety technologies designed to help drivers recognize and respond to potential hazards on the road. The features of Mazda i-ACTIVSENSE include: 

1. Mazda Radar Cruise Control (MRCC): This feature uses radar to detect the vehicle ahead and helps maintain a preset speed and distance from it. 

2. Smart Brake Support (SBS): SBS helps reduce the likelihood of a collision when driving at low speeds. It can detect vehicles and pedestrians ahead and will apply the brakes if necessary. 

3. Driver Attention Alert (DAA): This feature monitors the driver&#39;s behavior and provides a warning if it senses the driver is distracted or drowsy. 

4. Lane Departure Warning System (LDWS): LDWS uses a camera to detect lane markings on the road and will provide an audio and visual warning if it senses the vehicle is straying outside the lane. 

5. Smart City Brake Support (SCBS): This feature uses a laser sensor to detect vehicles and pedestrians ahead and will apply the brakes if necessary. 

6. Adaptive Front-lighting System (AFS): AFS helps the driver see better in darkness by automatically adjusting the headlight angle when cornering.

## Capabilties of Acura Sensing

Acura Sensing is a suite of advanced driver-assistance features designed to provide improved safety, convenience, and awareness while driving. The features include: 

1. Collision Mitigation Braking System (CMBS): This system uses millimeter-wave radar and a camera to detect the possibility of a collision, and applies brakes if necessary.

2. Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC): This system maintains a set speed and follows the vehicle ahead.

3. Lane Keeping Assist System (LKAS): This system uses a camera to detect lane markings and helps keep the vehicle centered in the lane.

4. Road Departure Mitigation System (RDMS): This system uses a camera to detect lane markings and helps prevent the vehicle from unintentionally leaving the lane.

5. Blind Spot Information System (BSI): This system uses radar sensors to detect vehicles in the blind spot and alerts the driver.

6. Forward Collision Warning System (FCW): This system uses a camera to detect the possibility of a collision and alerts the driver. 

7. Rear Cross Traffic Monitor (RCTM): This system uses radar sensors to detect vehicles approaching from the side and alerts the driver.
