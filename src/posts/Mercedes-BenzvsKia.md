# Mercedes-Benz Driver Assistance vs. Kia Smart Sense

In the past few years, car manufacturers have been adding driver assistance features to new cars. These features add convenience and safety in ways we've come to expectâ€”like rearview cameras and automatic braking. But you might not be aware that your car can actually drive itself without any human input at all. This technology is called Autonomous Driving (ADAS), and it's available on some vehicles today.

Driver Assistance and Smart Sense are two examples of an ADAS system. Let's examine their capabilities as well as how they rank against similar systems.

## Capabilties of Mercedes-Benz Driver Assistance

Acura Sensing is a suite of advanced driver-assistance features designed to provide improved safety, convenience, and awareness while driving. The features include: 

1. Collision Mitigation Braking System (CMBS): This system uses millimeter-wave radar and a camera to detect the possibility of a collision, and applies brakes if necessary.

2. Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC): This system maintains a set speed and follows the vehicle ahead.

3. Lane Keeping Assist System (LKAS): This system uses a camera to detect lane markings and helps keep the vehicle centered in the lane.

4. Road Departure Mitigation System (RDMS): This system uses a camera to detect lane markings and helps prevent the vehicle from unintentionally leaving the lane.

5. Blind Spot Information System (BSI): This system uses radar sensors to detect vehicles in the blind spot and alerts the driver.

6. Forward Collision Warning System (FCW): This system uses a camera to detect the possibility of a collision and alerts the driver. 

7. Rear Cross Traffic Monitor (RCTM): This system uses radar sensors to detect vehicles approaching from the side and alerts the driver.

## Capabilties of Kia Smart Sense

Infiniti ProPILOT Assist is a driver assistance technology that helps drivers stay in their lane and maintain a safe distance from the vehicle ahead. It features three main components:

1. Lane Keep Assist: This feature helps keep the vehicle in its lane by providing gentle steering guidance when the vehicle drifts from its lane.

2. Intelligent Cruise Control: This feature will maintain a safe distance from the vehicle ahead by automatically adjusting its speed to match the speed of the vehicle ahead.

3. Stop &amp; Go: This feature will bring the vehicle to a complete stop and then start again when traffic begins to move.

Infiniti ProPILOT Assist also includes additional features such as lane change assist, blind spot warning, and predictive forward collision warning.
