# BMW Active Driving Assistance Pro vs. Acura Sensing

In the past few years, car manufacturers have been adding driver assistance features to new cars. These features add convenience and safety in ways we've come to expectâ€”like rearview cameras and automatic braking. But you might not be aware that your car can actually drive itself without any human input at all. This technology is called Autonomous Driving (ADAS), and it's available on some vehicles today.

Active Driving Assistance Pro and Sensing are two examples of an ADAS system. Let's examine their capabilities as well as how they rank against similar systems.

## Capabilties of BMW Active Driving Assistance Pro

BMW Active Driving Assistance Pro is a suite of advanced driver assistance technologies designed to provide a safer, more comfortable driving experience. The features of BMW Active Driving Assistance Pro include:

1. Active Cruise Control: Uses sensors to maintain a set speed and distance from the vehicle ahead.

2. Lane Keeping Assist: Automatically adjusts the vehicle&#39;s path to avoid drifting out of the lane.

3. Active Lane Change Assist: Automatically changes lanes when the driver signals.

4. Active Blind Spot Detection: Warns the driver if there is a vehicle in the blind spot.

5. Crossing Traffic Warning: Warns the driver of oncoming vehicles when making a left turn.

6. Speed Limit Information: Displays the current speed limit.

7. Evasion Aid: Helps the driver to safely avoid a collision.

8. Collision Warning with City Braking: Warns the driver of potential collisions ahead and applies the brakes if necessary.

## Capabilties of Acura Sensing

Acura Sensing is a suite of advanced driver-assistance features designed to provide improved safety, convenience, and awareness while driving. The features include: 

1. Collision Mitigation Braking System (CMBS): This system uses millimeter-wave radar and a camera to detect the possibility of a collision, and applies brakes if necessary.

2. Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC): This system maintains a set speed and follows the vehicle ahead.

3. Lane Keeping Assist System (LKAS): This system uses a camera to detect lane markings and helps keep the vehicle centered in the lane.

4. Road Departure Mitigation System (RDMS): This system uses a camera to detect lane markings and helps prevent the vehicle from unintentionally leaving the lane.

5. Blind Spot Information System (BSI): This system uses radar sensors to detect vehicles in the blind spot and alerts the driver.

6. Forward Collision Warning System (FCW): This system uses a camera to detect the possibility of a collision and alerts the driver. 

7. Rear Cross Traffic Monitor (RCTM): This system uses radar sensors to detect vehicles approaching from the side and alerts the driver.
