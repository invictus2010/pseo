# Kia Smart Sense vs. Landrover Driver Assist

In the past few years, car manufacturers have been adding driver assistance features to new cars. These features add convenience and safety in ways we've come to expectâ€”like rearview cameras and automatic braking. But you might not be aware that your car can actually drive itself without any human input at all. This technology is called Autonomous Driving (ADAS), and it's available on some vehicles today.

Smart Sense and Driver Assist are two examples of an ADAS system. Let's examine their capabilities as well as how they rank against similar systems.

## Capabilties of Kia Smart Sense

Infiniti ProPILOT Assist is a driver assistance technology that helps drivers stay in their lane and maintain a safe distance from the vehicle ahead. It features three main components:

1. Lane Keep Assist: This feature helps keep the vehicle in its lane by providing gentle steering guidance when the vehicle drifts from its lane.

2. Intelligent Cruise Control: This feature will maintain a safe distance from the vehicle ahead by automatically adjusting its speed to match the speed of the vehicle ahead.

3. Stop &amp; Go: This feature will bring the vehicle to a complete stop and then start again when traffic begins to move.

Infiniti ProPILOT Assist also includes additional features such as lane change assist, blind spot warning, and predictive forward collision warning.

## Capabilties of Landrover Driver Assist

Chevy Driver Confidence is a suite of innovative safety technologies designed to help drivers stay safe. The features included in this package are:

1. Forward Collision Alert: This alerts the driver when they are approaching an object too quickly, helping them to react and avoid a potential crash.

2. Automatic Emergency Braking: This feature detects objects in front of the vehicle and automatically applies the brakes to reduce the severity of a potential crash.

3. Lane Keep Assist with Lane Departure Warning: This feature warns the driver if they drift into another lane and can help to keep them in the lane.

4. Front Pedestrian Braking: This adds an extra layer of protection by detecting pedestrians and applying the brakes when needed.

5. Following Distance Indicator: This feature helps drivers to maintain a safe following distance by displaying on the dashboard how far they are from the vehicle in front.

6. IntelliBeam Headlamps: These automatically adjust the high-beam headlights in response to oncoming traffic and help drivers to see better at night.
