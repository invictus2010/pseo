# Acura Sensing vs. Buick Driver Confidence

In the past few years, car manufacturers have been adding driver assistance features to new cars. These features add convenience and safety in ways we've come to expectâ€”like rearview cameras and automatic braking. But you might not be aware that your car can actually drive itself without any human input at all. This technology is called Autonomous Driving (ADAS), and it's available on some vehicles today.

Sensing and Driver Confidence are two examples of an ADAS system. Let's examine their capabilities as well as how they rank against similar systems.

## Capabilties of Acura Sensing

Acura Sensing is a suite of advanced driver-assistance features designed to provide improved safety, convenience, and awareness while driving. The features include: 

1. Collision Mitigation Braking System (CMBS): This system uses millimeter-wave radar and a camera to detect the possibility of a collision, and applies brakes if necessary.

2. Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC): This system maintains a set speed and follows the vehicle ahead.

3. Lane Keeping Assist System (LKAS): This system uses a camera to detect lane markings and helps keep the vehicle centered in the lane.

4. Road Departure Mitigation System (RDMS): This system uses a camera to detect lane markings and helps prevent the vehicle from unintentionally leaving the lane.

5. Blind Spot Information System (BSI): This system uses radar sensors to detect vehicles in the blind spot and alerts the driver.

6. Forward Collision Warning System (FCW): This system uses a camera to detect the possibility of a collision and alerts the driver. 

7. Rear Cross Traffic Monitor (RCTM): This system uses radar sensors to detect vehicles approaching from the side and alerts the driver.

## Capabilties of Buick Driver Confidence

Buick Driver Confidence is a suite of advanced driver assistance technologies designed to help drivers stay safe and confident on the road. The features include: 

1. Forward Collision Alert: This system uses radar sensors to detect vehicles in front of your car and alert you if it senses a potential collision.

2. Lane Departure Warning: This system uses a camera to monitor lane markings and will alert you if you drift out of your lane.

3. Side Blind Zone Alert: This system uses radar sensors to detect vehicles in your blind spot and alert you if it senses a potential collision.

4. Rear Cross Traffic Alert: This system uses radar sensors to detect vehicles behind your car and alert you if it senses a potential collision.

5. Automatic Parking Assist: This system uses cameras and sonar sensors to guide you into parking spaces and alert you when your car is close to obstacles.

6. Adaptive Cruise Control: This system uses radar sensors to maintain a pre-set distance from the vehicle ahead and automatically adjusts your speed accordingly.
