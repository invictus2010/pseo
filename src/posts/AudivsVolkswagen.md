# Audi Driver Assistance Plus vs. Volkswagen Driver Assist

In the past few years, car manufacturers have been adding driver assistance features to new cars. These features add convenience and safety in ways we've come to expect—like rearview cameras and automatic braking. But you might not be aware that your car can actually drive itself without any human input at all. This technology is called Autonomous Driving (ADAS), and it's available on some vehicles today.

Driver Assistance Plus and Driver Assist are two examples of an ADAS system. Let's examine their capabilities as well as how they rank against similar systems.

## Capabilties of Audi Driver Assistance Plus

Audi Driver Assistance Plus is a suite of driver assistance features designed to make driving more comfortable, convenient and safe. The features included in this package are:
