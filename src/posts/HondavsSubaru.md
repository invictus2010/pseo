# Honda Sensing vs. Subaru Eyesight

In the past few years, car manufacturers have been adding driver assistance features to new cars. These features add convenience and safety in ways we've come to expectâ€”like rearview cameras and automatic braking. But you might not be aware that your car can actually drive itself without any human input at all. This technology is called Autonomous Driving (ADAS), and it's available on some vehicles today.

Sensing and Eyesight are two examples of an ADAS system. Let's examine their capabilities as well as how they rank against similar systems.

## Capabilties of Honda Sensing

nHonda Sensing is a suite of driver-assistive safety and driver-assistive convenience technologies designed to help make your drive easier and safer. Honda Sensing includes the following features: 

1. Collision Mitigation Braking System (CMBS): CMBS uses a combination of radar and camera technology to detect obstacles in front of the vehicle. If a potential collision is detected, it can alert the driver and apply brake pressure to reduce the severity of a collision or avoid it altogether. 

2. Road Departure Mitigation System (RDM): RDM uses a combination of camera and radar technology to detect when the vehicle is leaving its lane without the turn signal being activated. It can then alert the driver and apply corrective steering torque to help keep the vehicle in its lane.

3. Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC): ACC uses radar technology to detect the vehicles in front and automatically adjusts the speed of the vehicle to maintain a pre-set following distance. 

4. Lane Keeping Assist System (LKAS): LKAS uses a combination of camera and steering torque technology to detect lane markings and provide corrective steering torque to help keep the vehicle in its lane. 

5. Traffic Sign Recognition (TSR): TSR uses a camera to detect and recognize speed limit signs, stop signs, and other traffic signs and can alert the driver to the current speed limit. 

6. Auto High Beam Headlights (AHB): AHB uses a camera to detect the headlights of oncoming vehicles and will automatically activate the high beams when no other vehicles are detected. 

## Capabilties of Subaru Eyesight

Infiniti ProPILOT Assist is a driver assistance technology that helps drivers stay in their lane and maintain a safe distance from the vehicle ahead. It features three main components:

1. Lane Keep Assist: This feature helps keep the vehicle in its lane by providing gentle steering guidance when the vehicle drifts from its lane.

2. Intelligent Cruise Control: This feature will maintain a safe distance from the vehicle ahead by automatically adjusting its speed to match the speed of the vehicle ahead.

3. Stop &amp; Go: This feature will bring the vehicle to a complete stop and then start again when traffic begins to move.

Infiniti ProPILOT Assist also includes additional features such as lane change assist, blind spot warning, and predictive forward collision warning.
