# Audi Driver Assistance Plus vs. Honda Sensing

In the past few years, car manufacturers have been adding driver assistance features to new cars. These features add convenience and safety in ways we've come to expect—like rearview cameras and automatic braking. But you might not be aware that your car can actually drive itself without any human input at all. This technology is called Autonomous Driving (ADAS), and it's available on some vehicles today.

Driver Assistance Plus and Sensing are two examples of an ADAS system. Let's examine their capabilities as well as how they rank against similar systems.

## Capabilties of Audi Driver Assistance Plus

Audi Driver Assistance Plus is a suite of driver assistance features designed to make driving more comfortable, convenient and safe. The features included in this package are:

•Adaptive Cruise Assist: This system uses a combination of radar and camera sensors to maintain a set distance from the car in front of you, helping you stay in the correct lane and reduce the risk of a collision.

•Audi Pre Sense: This system uses a range of sensors to detect potential hazards on the road and can warn the driver of a potential collision.

•Audi Side Assist: This system uses radar sensors to monitor blind-spot areas and can alert you when another vehicle is in your blind spot.

•Audi Active Lane Assist: This system uses a combination of camera and steering sensors to detect when you are drifting out of your lane and will provide corrective steering input to help you stay in your lane.

•Traffic Jam Assist: This system uses a combination of adaptive cruise control, active lane assist and steering sensors to help you stay in your lane and maintain a set speed in traffic.

•Park Assist: This system uses cameras and sensors to help you park in tight spaces.

## Capabilties of Honda Sensing

nHonda Sensing is a suite of driver-assistive safety and driver-assistive convenience technologies designed to help make your drive easier and safer. Honda Sensing includes the following features: 

1. Collision Mitigation Braking System (CMBS): CMBS uses a combination of radar and camera technology to detect obstacles in front of the vehicle. If a potential collision is detected, it can alert the driver and apply brake pressure to reduce the severity of a collision or avoid it altogether. 

2. Road Departure Mitigation System (RDM): RDM uses a combination of camera and radar technology to detect when the vehicle is leaving its lane without the turn signal being activated. It can then alert the driver and apply corrective steering torque to help keep the vehicle in its lane.

3. Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC): ACC uses radar technology to detect the vehicles in front and automatically adjusts the speed of the vehicle to maintain a pre-set following distance. 

4. Lane Keeping Assist System (LKAS): LKAS uses a combination of camera and steering torque technology to detect lane markings and provide corrective steering torque to help keep the vehicle in its lane. 

5. Traffic Sign Recognition (TSR): TSR uses a camera to detect and recognize speed limit signs, stop signs, and other traffic signs and can alert the driver to the current speed limit. 

6. Auto High Beam Headlights (AHB): AHB uses a camera to detect the headlights of oncoming vehicles and will automatically activate the high beams when no other vehicles are detected.
